# Testing using Jest - React Library

✅ Unit Testing: JobList Component

The JobList component is fully covered with unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library, with proper mocking of both Zustand store and Axios for API interactions.
🧪 Testing Setup Highlights

    ✅ Zustand store (useJobStore) successfully mocked

    ✅ Axios HTTP requests stubbed using Jest

    ✅ tsconfig configured with:

        jsx: react-jsx

        esModuleInterop: true (to avoid import issues)

    ✅ Jest environment set up with jest-environment-jsdom for DOM simulation

🔍 Test Cases Covered

    ✅ Renders "No jobs available" when store is empty

    ✅ Renders job listings correctly with mock data

    ✅ Edits a job and updates state on "Save"

    ✅ Cancels edit mode and reverts UI changes

    ✅ Deletes a job and confirms store update
